# Timeit `timeit`

Measures execution time of an expression.

```clj
;; Measure simple calculation
(timeit (+ 1 2))
0.015

;; Measure function execution
(timeit (map (fn [x] (* x 2)) [1 2 3 4 5]))
0.245

;; Measure with error handling
(timeit (try (/ 1 0) {e: "Division by zero"}))
0.032

;; Multiple expressions
(timeit (do (set x 10) (+ x 20) (* x 2)))
0.128
```

!!! info "Syntax"
